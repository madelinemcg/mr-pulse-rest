# Instructions to run server locally


### Python Environment and Dependencies

You can set up a python environment or download these dependencies:
    -Flask: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/installation/
    -Numpy: https://numpy.org/install/
    -Python3: https://www.python.org/downloads/

The frontend is managed with yarn, see client README for instructions
 
If that is working, the build created will be served by the Flask backend.

### Run Server

Run the server by navigating to the api directory, then run
`flask run`

It should have a link to the localhost url in the terminal that you can CTRL+CLICK
this will route you to the home/landing page

This runs what has been compiled in the build folder on the frontend
