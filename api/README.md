# Instructions to run server locally


### Python Environment and Dependencies

You can set up a python environment or download these dependencies:
-Flask
-Numpy
-Python3

The frontend is managed with yarn, which needs to be installed, then run
`yarn install` to install depedencies
 
If that is working, run `yarn build` to create a production build that
will be used by the Flask backend.

### Run Server

Run the server by navigating to the server directory, then run
`flask run`

It should have a link to the localhost url in the terminal that you can CTRL+CLICK
this will route you to the home/landing page

This runs what has been compiled in the build folder on the frontend
